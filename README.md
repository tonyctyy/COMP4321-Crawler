## Bugs
- WordID 33 is not found in the database. 

## Discussion
- How to store the words of the title in each page?
Now, we use "extractWords" in Spider to extract all the words in a page and store them in the inverted file.

- How to manage multiple databases?


## To-Do
- In the Indexer, we need to check if the existing table is not empty, then we need to update the table instead of creating a new one.
